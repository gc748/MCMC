Description: Creates multiple functions for sampling and one for
    for diagnosing the samples with Gelman diagnostics. 
    "inverse.cdf" generates any number of samples from a given CDF.
    "accept.reject" uses the accept-reject method to accept inputs
    only if their respective output is under the target pdf.
    "MCMC.metropolis" accepts perturbation steps only if they
    represent a higher density from the previous point. "Gelman"
    accepts many MCMC and diagnoses a number of related statistics.
